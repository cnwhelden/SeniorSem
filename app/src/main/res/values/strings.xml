    <!-- Info Page -->
    <string name="infoDesc">Maps have suggested ability descriptors. Shenandoah\'s Hiking Difficulty is determined by a numerical rating using the following formula:</string>
    <string name="difficultyTitle">Hiking Difficulty</string>
    <string name="hikeExample">Elevation Gain x 2 x distance (in miles). The product\'s square root is the numerical rating.
                    For example, a 10-mile hike that gains 2,200 feet in elevation:\n
                    2,200 x 2=4,400\n
                    4,400 x 10 = 44,000\n
                    Square root of 44,000=209.8</string>
